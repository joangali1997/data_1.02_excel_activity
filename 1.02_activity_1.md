- 1. Can you explain what is the case study?
- 2. Brainstorm on the possible sets of goals (questions that will help the business) that can be achieved with the data - **Lean Brainstorming:** _Have every student write on a piece of paper as many goals can be achieved as they can think of in a minute. Then, have everybody show their piece of paper to the camera or paste them on the wall. Lastly, the instructor will go over some of the answers they can see, calling out coincidences, ridiculous ideas and other singularities that may appear._
- 3. List the key objectives/goals
- 4. What will be the steps that you would follow to conduct the analysis process?
